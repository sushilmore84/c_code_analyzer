## Executive Summary

The Emergency Rule ensures proper identification and pricing of emergency room claims by automatically applying premium rate adjustments when emergency procedures are performed at designated facilities. This rule protects the organization from revenue leakage while maintaining regulatory compliance with emergency care pricing requirements. The automated classification reduces manual processing costs and ensures consistent application of emergency pricing across all claims, directly impacting profitability and operational efficiency.

## Business Description

When a claim is for an emergency procedure at an Emergency Room facility, the system marks it as emergency and applies premium pricing.

---

## Rule Logic

### Conditions (IF)

1. When the claim is for an emergency room visit
2. When the emergency procedure cannot be verified

### Actions (THEN)

1. The system will mark the claim as an emergency case
2. The system will apply a higher premium rate to the base reimbursement amount

### Decision Logic

**Decision Flow:**
The Emergency Rule activates when our system processes a claim for an emergency room visit and encounters a verification issue with the emergency procedure. This typically happens when the medical codes or documentation don't clearly confirm that the treatment was truly an emergency situation, or when standard verification processes cannot authenticate the urgency of the care provided. The rule is designed to handle these uncertain emergency scenarios where we need additional safeguards.

**Resulting Actions:**
When this rule triggers, the system takes two important steps. First, it flags the claim with a special "emergency case" designation, which ensures the claim receives appropriate priority handling and review by our emergency claims specialists. Second, the system automatically applies a higher premium rate to calculate the reimbursement amount. This increased rate reflects the elevated costs typically associated with emergency room care and helps ensure adequate coverage for legitimate emergency treatments, even when verification is incomplete.

## Execution Flow

1. System triggers Emergency Rule when Validate Emergency Facility or Validate Claim functions execute
2. System checks if facility type equals Emergency Room OR if emergency procedure verification fails
3. If either condition is true, claim is marked as emergency status
4. Emergency premium adjustment is applied to the base rate
5. Updated claim data flows to Print Summary, Validate Claim, Verify Provider Specialty, and Apply Emergency Premium modules
